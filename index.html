            The Mandalorians were a clan-based cultural group that was composed of members from multiple species all bound by 
            a common creed, language and code, and played a particularly important role in galactic history as legendary warriors 
            with a fearsome reputation as conquerors as well as mercenaries and bounty hunters.
